# Personal_Expense

A dashboard analyzing my personal spending and saving behaviours
Tool: PowerBI 
The project break-down: 
- Data Description
- Report Structure
- Insights


## Data Description
The Dataset is taken from my bank transaction from 1/3/2024 to 30/6/2024 and was further processed. The fields included in original data are: Date, Transaction Description, Debit, Credit, Balance
I added the categories based on Transaction Description for a broader analysis (Transaction Description is removed in the current data for privacy)
The dataset imported in the model are: 
  (1) Transactions: the details of transactions in Smart Access (Spending) Account with dates, categories and Debit/Credit amount
  (2) Savings: the details of transaction in Savings account with dates, categories and Debit/Credit amount

## Report Structure
The Report is uploaded as [*PowerBI file*](https://github.com/hanhng294/Personal_Expense/blob/main/personal_expense.pbix) or [*PDF File*](https://github.com/hanhng294/Personal_Expense/blob/main/personal_expense.pdf) 
The Report has 2 pages for (1) Spending and (2) Savings

- Spending: The page features a bar chart displaying monthly spending amounts and a donut chart illustrating the composition of spending categories. Additionally, a bar chart provides a detailed analysis of spending by category and month (In this visualization, certain categories such as rent, parental support, loans, and health insurance, are excluded as they are unavoidable expenses. The bar chart focuses on non-essential spending to identify opportunities for improving spending habits.). I have also added average daily spending and the category with most expensive spendings for quick facts.

- Savings: The page includes a column and line chart to visualize monthly savings and the accrued savings balance. A donut chart highlights the category composition, while a bar chart breaks down spending from savings by category and month. Quick statistics display the average monthly savings and the category with the highest spending.
